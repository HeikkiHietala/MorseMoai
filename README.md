# MorseMoai
This project enables you to build a system that communicates in morse code and both reads messages off the Web and writes data on when it was triggered.

I am using an ESP32 DevKitC and this code works with it.

I have used dhylands' python_lcd library and the micropython-hcsr04 from rsc1975.

See my blog at www.sabulo.com for all my projects with Arduino, ESP32, 3D modeling with Blender, and 3D printing with a variety of machines.
